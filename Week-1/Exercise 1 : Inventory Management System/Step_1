Q1)Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.  
Solution:- 
  The question can be answered using these three points:
  ->Data structures and algorithms are essential for handling large inventories because they ensure efficient data retrieval, insertion, and deletion. 
  ->They help manage memory effectively, maintain data integrity, and enable complex queries.
  ->Efficient algorithms also ensure that operations remain fast and scalable, even as the inventory grows.
      This is crucial for real-time processing and smooth operations in large inventory systems.

Q2)Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem. 
Solution:-
  The different types of data stuctures suitable for this problem are:
  ->ArrayList
  ->HashMap
