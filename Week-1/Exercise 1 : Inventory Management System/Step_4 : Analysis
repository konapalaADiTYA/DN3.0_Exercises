Q1)Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
Solution:-
  The time complexityof each operations are:
  ->Addition of a new product : O(1)
  ->update of a product : O(1)
  ->delete of a product from inventory : O(1)

Q2)Discuss how you can optimize these operations. 
Solution:-
  There is no further optimization is required as the time complexity of all the operations in HashMap is already in O(1).
