Q1)Analyze the time complexity of each operation.
Solution:-
  Time complexity of each operation:
    ->add: O(n)
    ->search: O(n)
    ->traverse: O(n)
    ->delete: O(n)

Q2)Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data.
Solution:-
  The advantages of linked lists over arrays are:-
    ->Dynamic Size: They don't have a fixed size like arrays and can easily grow and shrink size by adding or removing nodes.
    ->Memory Utilization: Linked lists are more efficient for dynamic data,unlike arrays which have unused allocated spaace.
    ->Effective Insertions/Deletions: Linked list are more effifcient because there is no need to shift elements while insertion or deletion.
