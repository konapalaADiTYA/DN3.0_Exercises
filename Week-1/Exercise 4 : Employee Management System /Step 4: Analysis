Q1)Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, search, traverse, delete).
Solution:-
  The time complexity of each of the operations is:
    ->add: O(1)
    ->search: O(n)
    ->traverse: O(n)
    ->delete: O(n)

Q2)Discuss the limitations of arrays and when to use them.
Solution:-
  Limitations of arrays:
    ->Fixed Size: Cannot change size once declared.
    ->Homogeneous Data: Only stores elements of the same type.
    ->Inefficient Insertions/Deletions: Especially in the middle of the array.
    ->Memory Waste: Unused elements still occupy space.
  When to use:
    ->Fixed Size Collections: Like days of the week.
    ->Sequential Access: When you need to iterate over elements.
    ->Random Access: Fast access using an index.
    ->Homogeneous Data: Storing similar data types like exam scores.
