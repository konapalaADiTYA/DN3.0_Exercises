Q1)Compare the performance (time complexity) of Bubble Sort and Quick Sort.
Solution:-
  Time complexity of Bubble Sort:
    ->Best Case: O(n)
    ->Average Case: O(n^2)
    ->Worst Case: O(n^2)
   Time complexity of Quick Sort:
    ->Best Case: O(n log n)
    ->Average Case: O(n log n)
    ->Worst Case: O(n^2)

Q2)Discuss why Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort. 
Solution:-
  Quick sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort because:
    ->More efficient for larger datasets.
    ->Has better time complexity then Bubble Sort.
    ->It sorts the array in-place.
    ->Performance can be improved with optimizations, such as choosing a better pivot element.
