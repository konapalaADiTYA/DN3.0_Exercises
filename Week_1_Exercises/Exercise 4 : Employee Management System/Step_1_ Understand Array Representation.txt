Q1)Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.
Solution:-
  Arrays are stored in a contiguos memory locations,which means each element is placed next to the previos one.
  This allows for efficient access since the computer can quickly calculate the address of the element using its index.
  Advantages:
    ->Fast access: We can directly access any element using its index value.
    ->Memory Efficiency: No extra memory for pointers  or metadataassociated with the elements.
    ->Easy Traversal: Easy to loop through any element.
