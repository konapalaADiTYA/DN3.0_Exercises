Q1)Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.
Solution:-
  Recursion: A method of solving a problem where a function calls itself as a subroutine.
             This allows the function to be repeated several times as it breaks the problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
             Recursion can simplify certain problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems, which can be easier to solve and understand.
