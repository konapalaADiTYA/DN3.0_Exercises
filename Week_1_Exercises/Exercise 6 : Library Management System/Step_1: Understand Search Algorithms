Q1)Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
Solution:-
  ->Linear Search: Linear Search is a search algorithm that checks each element in a array sequentially until the target element is found or the end of the array is reached.
  ->Binary Search: Binary search is an efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, comparing the target value to the middle element,
                    and narrowing down the search to the left or right half accordingly.
