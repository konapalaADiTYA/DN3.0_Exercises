Q1)Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
Solution:-
  Time compllexity for Linear Search:
    ->Best Case: O(1)
    ->Average Case: O(n)
    ->Worst Case: O(n)

  Time compllexity for Binary Search:
    ->Best Case: O(1)
    ->Average Case: O(log n)
    ->Worst Case: O(log n)

Q2)Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.
Solution:-
  We use Linear Search when we work with:
    ->Small and unsorted arrays.
    ->with data staructures like linked list.
  We use Binary Search when we work with:
    ->Larg and sorted arrays.
    ->with data structures that allow random access like array.
