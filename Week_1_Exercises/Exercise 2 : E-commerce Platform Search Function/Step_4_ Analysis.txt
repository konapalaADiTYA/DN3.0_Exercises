Q1)Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
Solution:-
  Time Complexity for Linear Search:
    ->Best Case: O(1)
    ->Average Case: O(n)
    ->Worst Case: O(n)
  Time Complexity for Binary Search:
    ->Best Case: O(1)
    ->Average Case: O(log n)
    ->Worst Case: O(log n)

Q2)Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.
Solution:- 
  For an E-commerce platform with large inventory binary search is preferred.
  Because of its faster search time. However the array must be sorted.
